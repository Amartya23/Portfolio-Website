                Knowledge? Absolutely. Skills? Most definitely. But there is another element, one so important that
                without it, knowledge and skills lie dormant: Action.

                In my experience, the ability to take action sits firmly on the foundation of a strong mindset. Consider
                these scenarios:

                * Have you wanted to answer a question at work that you were sure you knew the answer to, but doubt
                crept in and you remained silent?

                * Perhaps you were in a team meeting and wanted to put yourself forward for an exciting opportunity, but
                instead shrunk away?

                *Or maybe you were part of a new, exciting project, however, felt unworthy of being there. So instead of
                actively contributing, you sat frozen with imposter syndrome</p>
